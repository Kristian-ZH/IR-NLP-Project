== Style of play ==
Regarded as a promising young prospect, Chiesa is a talented, fast, skillful, and hardworking player, with good technique, a short stature, and a slender build. Possessing good stamina, acceleration, and dribbling skills, he usually plays as a right winger, a position which enables him to create goalscoring opportunities for teammates, especially by crossing the ball into the penalty box with his stronger right foot. He is also capable of scoring goals himself, and can play on the left wing, a role which allows him to beat opponents with the ball in one on one situations, and cut into the center to shoot on goal with his stronger foot, in particular from outside of the penalty area, despite also being an accurate striker of the ball with his left foot.
Aside from his favoured roles on either flank, he has also been deployed in several other attacking positions, given his capability of playing anywhere across the front line; he has most frequently been played in a central role as either an attacking midfielder or second striker, but has also been fielded as a main striker on occasion. He has even occasionally been used in deeper midfield roles, including as central midfielder. His pace and movement off the ball allow him to exploit spaces and make attacking runs to beat the defensive line and provide depth to his team.In addition to his primary duties in attack, he is also known for his energy and work-rate, and often contributes to the defensive phase of the game by pressing opponents and chasing the opposition's wingers down the flank in order to win back possession, and has even occasionally been deployed as a right–sided wing back in a 3–5–2 formation. Moreover, he is highly regarded in the media for his composure, due to his penchant for scoring decisive goals in important matches.


== Personal life ==
Chiesa's father, Enrico, was also a professional footballer; he played for various Serie A clubs, most notably Parma, Fiorentina and Siena, and represented the Italy national team. Chiesa enrolled at the International School of Florence, where he frequently took English lessons. He also spent two years at university, studying Sports Science.
